    <p>In ancient Rome, there was the habit of celebrating the birthday of a person. There weren’t parties like we know
        today, but cakes were prepared and offers were made. Then, the habits of wishing happy birthday, giving gifts
        and lighting candles became popular as a way to protect the birthday person from devils and ensure good things
        to the next year in the person’s life. The celebrations only became popular like we know today after fourteen
        centuries, in a collective festival performed in Germany</p>


    <p>The first department store was created in Paris, in 1850. It was conceived as a big place with a lot of options
        in products and brands. They wouldn’t sell just a specific product: there you could find clothes, shoes, jewels,
        make up and many others things. That concept remained until today. So, if you want to buy many things with good
        prices, you can choose from one of the thousands in the world.

        Every year, on the day after Thanksgiving, most of this stores have a big sale called Black Friday. On this day,
        it is possible to buy products with big discounts and you also have the option to buy things online. In 2016,
        more than 154 million people spent USD 3,3 billion dollars shopping only on the internet.</p>


    <p>Even if you have never visited Los Angeles, you have probably heard about the most famous sidewalk in the world:
        the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Every year, around 10 million tourists visit this street to take pictures with their
        idol’s star.

        Since 1960, the Hollywood Boulevard Avenue attracts visitors to see star-plaques with the names of celebrities:
        actors, singers, movie directors, stage performers or anyone who has contributed to make Hollywood known
        worldwide. Each pink star is made of a marble called terrazzo, a bronze shield with the honoree’s name and an
        icon of the celebrity job, like a camera, television or a microphone, for example.</p>
