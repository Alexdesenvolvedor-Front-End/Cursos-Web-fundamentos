        It was my birthday. My boyfriend Daniel came to my house to take me out for dinner. I opened the door, and he
        had a big bunch of flowers and a very nice car. He rented the car just to take me out. I was really surprised.
        I went to our house in the country with my Family. It’s a small house in a village in the mountains. We often go
        there at the weekends and we usually go there for a few weeks in the summer. It was really hot when we went this
        weekend. It was 35 degrees. I was surprised because it’s July. It’s usually cold.

        I had a really terrible weekend. My boyfriend took me out to this really expensive restaurant. In the middle of
        our dinner, he gave me a very beautiful ring and he asked me to marry him. I was really surprised. I said no. I
        like him, but I knew I didn’t want to marry him. He was quite angry and sad. It was awful.
        I had a great weekend. My wife and I got married 30 years ago. My wife and I were really surprised when our son
        came to our house on Thursday evening. He then took us to the airport and gave us two tickets to go to Rome! He
        paid for everything: the flight, the hotel, everything. We had a lovely weekend. We remembered the night we got
        married. It was wonderful.

        My Wonderful Family
        I live in a house near the mountains. I have two brothers and one sister, and I was born last. My father teaches
        mathematics, and my mother is a nurse at a big hospital. My brothers are very smart and work hard in school. My
        sister is a nervous girl, but she is very kind. My grandmother also lives with us. She came from Italy when I
        was two years old. She has grown old, but she is still very strong. She cooks the best food!

        My family is very important to me. We do lots of things together. My brothers and I like to go on long walks in
        the mountains. My sister likes to cook with my grandmother. On the weekends we all play board games together. We
        laugh and always have a good time. I love my family very much.

    <p>My name is John
        Hi! Nice to meet you! My name is John Smith. I am 19 and a student in college. I go to college in New York. My
        favorite courses are Geometry, French, and History. English is my hardest course. My professors are very
        friendly and smart. It’s my second year in college now. I love it!

        I live in a big house on Ivy Street. It’s near the college campus. I share the house with three other students.
        Their names are Bill, Tony, and Paul. We help each other with homework. On the weekend, we play football
        together.

        I have a younger brother. He just started high school. He is 14 and lives with my parents. They live on Mulberry
        Street in Boston. Sometimes they visit me in New York. I am happy when they visit. My Mom always brings me
        sweets and candy when they come. I really miss them, too!</p>
